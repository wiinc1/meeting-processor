TRANSCRIPT:
----------------------------------------
[00:00] John: Welcome everyone to our product planning meeting. Let's start by reviewing our Q1 objectives.
[00:15] Sarah: Thanks John. I've prepared the roadmap for our new features. The main focus should be on user experience improvements.
[00:30] Mike: I agree with Sarah. We need to prioritize the mobile app redesign. Our current metrics show a 15% drop in mobile engagement.
[00:45] John: That's a significant drop. What's our timeline for the mobile redesign?
[01:00] Sarah: We're looking at 6-8 weeks for the complete redesign. We can start with the core user flows first.
[01:15] Mike: Perfect. I'll coordinate with the design team to get the wireframes ready by next week.
[01:30] John: Great. Let's also discuss the analytics dashboard. Sarah, what's the status on that?
[01:45] Sarah: The analytics dashboard is 80% complete. We're just waiting for the final API integrations.
[02:00] Mike: Excellent. That should be ready for testing by the end of the month.
[02:15] John: Perfect. Any other items we need to cover today?
[02:30] Sarah: Just one more thing - we need to finalize the budget allocation for the marketing campaign.
[02:45] Mike: I'll send the updated budget proposal by tomorrow. Should we schedule a follow-up meeting?
[03:00] John: Yes, let's meet again next Friday to review progress. Thanks everyone for a productive meeting.
