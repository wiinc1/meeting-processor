SUMMARY:
----------------------------------------
The meeting focused on reviewing the Mohawk prechecker installation and configuring the questionnaire for a security assessment. Key points included scanning three domains, validating service accounts, and ensuring trust relationships. The team discussed the need for a service account with specific permissions and the importance of vaulting and password management for service accounts. They also addressed the classification of privileged accounts, including domain admins, CSA accounts, and local accounts, and the need for inventorying and managing these accounts. The next steps involve setting up the scan server, running the prerequisite checker, and configuring the necessary credentials for the assessment.
